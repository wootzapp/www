The UX for Crypto is broken. We are fixing it..right  in your pocket.
Wootz is a mobile browser for the crypto web. IPhone and Android. 

### Why Wootz

Wootz steel originated in South India - in present day Kodumanal, Tamil Nadu. The word "*wootz*" appears to have originated as a mistranscription of *wook*  - from the Tamil language root word *urukku*.

Trade spread the technology to the city of Damascus, where an industry developed for making weapons of this steel..and began to be known as Damascus steel. 

After the First War of Indian Independence of 1857, the colonial British government frowned upon weapon-making by Indians. This led to the stoppage of the production of Wootz. And the secret was lost forever.

Wootz is the strongest, sharpest and best steel in the world. Definitely better than Chrome ;)
